# waybackurls.pl
> Search for urls of (sub)domains using the web archive database

This tool is mainly based on [waybackurls](https://github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls) by tomnomnom.

The biggest difference between this tool and the one on which it is based is the ability to filter results based on status code, Mime-Type and file extension, which allows obtaining more relevant results within the context of a specific target.

Furthermore, in the current version, the only source of query is the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/).
